# Car-Price-Prediction-LassoCV

About Dataset
This dataset contains detailed information about used cars, including key features such as make, model, year of manufacture, engine size, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and price. It is designed to support data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasksâ€”particularly regression models aimed at predicting car prices.

The Price column is the target variable, and all other features can be used as inputs to estimate the value of a vehicle based on its specifications and condition.

This dataset is suitable for beginner and intermediate data science projects, including:

1-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2-Feature engineering

3-Regression modeling

4-Model evaluation and comparison

The Feature :

1-Make: The manufacturer or brand of the vehicle (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Ford).

2-Model: The variant or trim level of the vehicle, labeled as 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'e'. These may represent different equipment levels, features, or configurations of the same car model.

2-Year: The year the car was manufactured or released.

3-Engine Size :The engine capacity in liters (L), indicating its total displacement and general performance level.

4-Mileage: The total distance the car has been driven, typically measured in kilometers or miles.

5-Fuel Type :The type of fuel the vehicle uses, such as Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, or Electric.

6-Transmission :The type of gearbox system used in the vehicle, commonly Manual or Automatic.

7-Price(target ):The selling price of the vehicle, usually in the local currency. This is the target variable, used for prediction in regression models to estimate car value based on other features.
